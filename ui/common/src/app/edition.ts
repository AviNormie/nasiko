/**
 * How an edition builds on the core (docs/lab-vs-react-migration-review.md §10.4). Pure TypeScript, no React:
 * the glue is edition-context.tsx.
 *
 * - The EDITION is fixed at build time: each edition's `src/edition.ts` names its id and its layers, and nothing
 *   checks it at run time except `useEdition()`. An OSS build contains no EE code at all (the build's leak guard).
 * - A layer changes the core only through `slots` (each has an OSS fallback in the core) and `nav` patches
 *   relative to core items; it never redeclares the item list, so a new core item shows in every edition.
 * - Capability (what this server can do right now) is still probed at run time, and only for features both
 *   editions have (the harness usage endpoint's bare vs coded 404, crash-guardian fields). A probe never stands in
 *   for the edition.
