/**
 * Every tour's steps. A step with a `target` points at `[data-tour~="<target>"]` and is shown only while that element
 * is on screen when the tour opens, so one tour serves a page's states (empty, member, phone) by dropping the steps
 * that don't apply. A step without one is a centred card: each tour opens with one, so it never comes out empty.
 *
 * Shared targets: `page-actions` and `page-stepper` are the shell top bar's slots (TopBar.tsx), `tour-button` its
 * help button (`TourButton`), `section-nav` the shared sub-nav (SectionNav). `tours.test.tsx` renders each page and
 * checks its targets still exist.
