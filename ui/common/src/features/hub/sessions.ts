/**
 * The hub's bounded session sample (plans/feat-agent-centric.md eng "Hub sessions"; replaces `useAgentSessions`, whose
 * start could exceed Tempo's 7-day search and lose every row's trace data). Pure.
 * - Start: the later of the agent's creation and 7 days back (Sessions' Tempo-safe start), so every row can be checked.
 * - Rows: `session/list` names agents by raw name ("" when unresolved); only this agent's rows created after it.
 *   Another visible agent with the same raw name makes the match ambiguous: the rows can't be told apart, so the lists
 *   and Needs you say so with what they show.
