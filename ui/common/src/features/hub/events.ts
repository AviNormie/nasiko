/**
 * Change markers for the agent hub (plans/feat-agent-centric.md PR1 "Marker sources", eng "Markers"). Pure: the hub
 * page feeds it the reads, tests feed it records.
 *
 * Markers draw only from records the server keeps, with their own timestamp:
 * - Builds (`/api/builds/agent/{id}`, newest 20): a finished build is "Build completed" at its `updated_at` (labelled
 *   approximate: the server keeps no finish time of its own), a failed one "Build failed" at its failure time; queued
 *   and building records are not drawn. Nothing is called "deployed": a successful build is not a deployment (eng).
 * - Versions join their build through `AgentVersion.build_id`: one marker per deploy, labelled with the version. A
 *   version with no build (a registry import) is "Version recorded" at its own time; a version whose build is outside
 *   the read is not drawn as build-less. When the viewer can't read builds at all, every version is its own marker.
 * - The latest crash (`crashed_at` on the current deployment row): EE only, since the OSS server never writes it (O-1).
 * - The proposed event log (AH-3), mock mode only until a server has it.
 *
 * Ids (`?marker=`, X3): `build:<build id>`, `version:<version>`, `crash:<crashed_at ISO>`, `event:<event id>`.
