/**
 * Needs you, for one agent (plans/feat-agent-centric.md PR1c; CEO R2-6, design "Needs you", DX "Errors"). Pure: the
 * hub feeds it three sources, re-sourced for this agent rather than filtered from the Overview's fleet sample.
 * - Requests: this agent's pending requests (a superuser sees only those a chat proves theirs, as chat's Waiting does;
 *   requests nobody can prove yet keep the verdict back, never count as zero).
 * - Status: the agent's rating from the Overview's rules (`overview/health.ts`), on the last 7 days. An agent the rules
 *   can't rate (stopped, not deployed, a harness, or one whose spend the viewer can't see) is absent, never "checked".
 * - Sessions: failures among this agent's sessions found in the hub's bounded sample. That sample is always partial (it
 *   is the latest N sessions the viewer can see, matched by raw name), so the card says what it checked (R2-6), and a
 *   name another visible agent shares is said with the failures.
 *
 * The verdict "No issues found in checked data" shows only when every source answered and found nothing; a failed source
 * shows its own line with Retry, never the verdict.
