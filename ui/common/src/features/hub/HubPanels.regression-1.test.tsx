/**
 * Regression: ISSUE-006 — an agent with no sessions in its sample read "the latest 0 sessions"
 * Found by /qa on 2026-10-11 (PR1c)
 * Report: .gstack/qa-reports/qa-report-localhost-2026-10-11.md
 *
 * The hub's session sample starts at the agent's creation (or 7 days back), so a harness created today scanned nothing,
 * and both Needs you and Recent sessions said "latest 0 sessions". An empty sample means this agent had none in 7 days.
 * (PR1b dated the mock's harnesses from their first session, so the page case now empties the sample directly.)
