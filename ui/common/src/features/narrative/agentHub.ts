/**
 * The agent hub's sentence (plans/feat-agent-centric.md PR1 "One sentence"; design "Sentence templates"). At most two
 * templated sentences, each mapped to data:
 * - Money, from the ACL-scoped dashboard's current and previous-window totals for the selected window (DX: no
 *   timeseries read). Left out when the viewer can't see the agent's spend. No comparison when the previous window
 *   had no spend or only part of it existed for this agent; "since <created date>" when the agent is younger than
 *   the window.
 * - The latest recorded change, as its own sentence.
 *
 * Product Principle 1: a change in a number and a marker are separate statements. No sentence ties them with
 * "since", "because", "due to", "led to" or "after" (the copy test in features/hub/logic.test.ts bans them; "since" only ever
 * introduces the creation date in the money sentence).
