/**
 * Token optimization for the viewer's coding harnesses, on the import card once they are in: the agent Settings switch
 * (agents/detail/TokenOptimization.tsx) as one row, over every harness that has an LLM config attached. Those are the
 * ones whose sessions go through Nasiko's LLM router, which is where the optimization runs (it compresses their tool
 * output, `compress_enabled`); a harness without one is left out, and with none the switch is disabled and says how
 * to attach one. On writes `compress_enabled: true` to each included harness that has it off, off writes `false` to
 * each one that has it on (`PUT /api/agents/{id}`, the bulk write the Optimization page uses), then the re-read lists
 * decide. Saved on flip, like the agent's; failures toast with the server's reason. Nothing renders until the viewer
 * owns a harness.
