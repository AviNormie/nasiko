/**
 * The Overview's search params, all shareable view state, all replaced, never pushed:
 * - `range`: the window the home reads its money for (7, 30 or 90 days), and what the village's volumes cover.
 * - `view`: what the page shows under its header: the cards (absent: the viewer's last pick, else the cards), or the
 *   estate's canvas as the village or the map; `list` (the List view, gone: its list is the Map's System card) still
 *   parses, and opens the map.
 * - `scope`: Org (admins) or Mine. Members only ever see Mine, so their links leave it out.
 * - `sel`: what the canvas has selected (`node:<id>`, `problem:<id>`, `flow:<id>`, `chain:<id>`, `opp:<id>`,
 *   `panel:<card>[:<kind>]`, `tile:<id>:<day>`, `sess:<id>:<index>`, `place:<id>`), so a link opens the same panel.
 * - `at`: a past day in the History slider (absent: live).
 * - `team`, `owner`, `kind`, `tier`: the canvas's filters.
 * Needs you keeps its own windows (its rules are defined on them). Loaded with the shell (the home's schema uses it), so
 * no query code here.
