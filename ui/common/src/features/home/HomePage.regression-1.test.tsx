// Regression: ISSUE-005 — with every session check failing (no trace store), Needs you still said "Nothing needs you"
// Found by /qa on 2026-09-29 (live, EE without Tempo)
// Report: .gstack/qa-reports/qa-report-localhost-2026-09-29.md
// Moved from the Overview to the home (plans/feat-agent-centric.md PR2a), which keeps the Needs you card.

// The original failure was a per-session status check (`session/{id}`) that
// 503'd on every row while Needs you reported an all-clear. The Overview no
// longer makes those requests — status comes from `session/list` — so the same
// invariant is now guarded on the read that actually carries it: the failed-
// session count. A source that could not answer must never read as "no failures".
