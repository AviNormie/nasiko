/**
 * The home's chart band (plans/feat-agent-centric.md PR2d, decisions #59-63). Pure: every figure comes from the rows
 * (ACL-scoped for every viewer) except spend over time, which reads per-agent series and, on Fleet, the fleet series
 * (superusers only: `spend-timeseries` isn't ACL-scoped).
 *
 * - By agent (spend, saved): the scope's largest values, the rest folded into one Other bar with its count.
 * - Over time: the top spenders' series stacked per UTC day; Other is the fleet's day minus theirs, on Fleet only.
 * - Cost × p95: the rows' dashboard figures, for TokenOps' own panel.
 * - Health: the rows per rating, harnesses and unrated agents counted as Not rated (the `?health=unknown` filter).
