//! Summarizes coding-agent receipts that predate migration 0063's typed turn
//! columns, in bounded chunks, after the server has started.
//!
//! The migration used to do this itself with one table-wide UPDATE: every
//! receipt rewritten inside the deploy's migration transaction, each row locked
//! until the last was done, with ingest blocked behind it. Here each chunk is its
//! own short transaction over at most `CHUNK` rows, skipping rows another
//! instance holds, so a large table is summarized in the background while the
//! server serves traffic, and two replicas share the work instead of colliding.
//!
//! Same rules as ingest's `TurnSummary`: tokens are every class over every LLM
//! call, summed in numeric and clamped to `BIGINT` (the wire counts are u64, and
//! one hostile receipt must not wedge the pass); tool errors are calls that
//! ended `failed` or `timed_out`.
