//! A once-a-minute report on coding-agent ingest: what the batch route did
//! (turns accepted, batches turned away by status) and what background work is
//! waiting (the OTLP outbox and the Tempo read-back).
//!
//! Written as a log line, which every deployment has, and as OTel gauges, for
//! one with a metrics pipeline. The line is `info` when anything happened or is
//! waiting, `debug` when idle, so a quiet server does not log every minute.
