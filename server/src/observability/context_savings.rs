//! `GET /api/observability/finops/context-savings` — how much conversation history each request
//! carried, before and after selection.
//!
//! # Why this is not part of `/finops/savings`
//!
//! The two answer different questions and divide by different denominators. `/finops/savings` asks
//! "what did each optimization layer remove, out of everything this scope spent", so its baseline
//! is all tokens. This endpoint asks "how much of the history we could have sent did we send", so
//! its baseline is the pool. The same data yields a very different percentage under each — serving
//! both from one response would publish two numbers that look comparable and are not.
//!
//! # One report per request, never per call
//!
//! A turn is several LLM calls; history is selected once for the turn. Counting a pool once per
//! call would multiply every figure here by the ReAct loop's depth, so the unit is the request and
//! the source is `context_reports`, not `token_usage`.
//!
//! # Costs are resolved here, not stored
//!
//! No model call has happened when selection runs, so no price is known at write time. Each report
//! is priced at its own request's first LLM call, joined through `model_pricing`. A request whose
//! model has no price row counts in `reports` but not in `priced_reports`, and the two cost figures
//! are `null` rather than 0 when nothing could be priced — an unknown cost is not a free one.
