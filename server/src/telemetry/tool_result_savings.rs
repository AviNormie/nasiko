//! Recording what IP-3 removed from one turn's tool results.
//!
//! The ReAct loop compresses every tool result as it stores it
//! (`oss/react-agent/src/context.rs::push_tool_result`). That has run in production since IP-3
//! shipped and reported nothing: `UNINSTRUMENTED_LAYERS` carried `compress_tool_result` precisely
//! so the dashboard said "not measured" rather than claiming a zero. This is the emitter that
//! retires that entry.
//!
//! Two sinks, the same pair `context_report` writes to and for the same reasons:
//!
//! * **The dispatch span**, as `nasiko.tool_results.*` — the trace page reads Tempo, not Postgres.
//! * **`token_savings`**, as one `compress_tool_result` row — the only shape `/finops/savings` can
//!   aggregate by window, agent and program.
//!
//! Counts only. Never the tool output itself.
//!
//! # Why this is a turn-level row, not a per-result one
//!
//! A ReAct turn calls several tools, and `token_savings` is keyed per (call, layer). One row per
//! *tool result* would multiply the layer's row count by the loop's fan-out while measuring the
//! same turn, and the page aggregates by summing — so the figure would be right and the row count
//! misleading. The tally accumulates across the turn and lands once, which is also the only grain
//! at which a streaming turn's spawned task can be observed at all.
