//! Agent-call identity resolution, shared.
//!
//! An agent proves *itself* with its deploy-time `MCP_GATEWAY_TOKEN`; the *user* it is working
//! for is never taken from the request. It is resolved from the `traceparent` against
//! `flows.user_id` with a `flow_participants` membership check, requiring a live flow — see
//! `docs/MCP_GATEWAY_AGENT_AUTH.md` §2.4. Presence is not the check, resolution is: there is
//! nothing an agent can fabricate to pass.
//!
//! This lives in its own public module rather than inside the gateway handler because more than
//! one layer has to make this decision, and each one making it *itself* is how the rule drifts.
//! `crate::catalog`'s EE counterpart records what that costs: it kept a private copy of token
//! extraction and JWT decode, and every rule later added to the shared validator silently did not
//! apply to it. One implementation, called from everywhere, is the fix.
