//! SQL for agent state.
//!
//! Every statement filters on `agent_id`, which callers take from the authenticated credential
//! and from nowhere else: that filter is the whole isolation story, so another agent's row is
//! not forbidden, it is simply never selected.
//!
//! Reads ignore a row once `expires_at` has passed, whether or not the sweeper has dealt with it
//! yet, and ignore a tombstone always. Writes to one entry are serialised by an advisory lock and
//! run read, check, write inside one transaction, which is what makes a version number mean
//! something under concurrency.
//!
//! Versions never restart. A delete does not remove the row: it empties it into a tombstone
//! (`deleted_at` set, payload gone) that keeps the version, and the sweeper does the same to a row
//! that expires. The next write of that entry continues from the kept version, so an `If-Match`
//! taken before the delete or expiry can never match the new row by accident. A tombstone is
//! kept for one TTL, then forgotten; a version older than that is beyond any precondition this
//! API promises to honour.
