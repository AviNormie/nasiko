//! The one place the platform's own deploy-time env is assembled.
//!
//! Every path that starts an agent workload (seed, import, upload, update, rollback, restart,
//! admin deploy, startup reconcile, GitHub clone) calls here instead of wiring credentials
//! itself, so a new platform credential reaches all of them at once and no path can quietly miss
//! one. What the platform injects, besides the LLM router wiring (`llm_router::wiring`) and
//! `MCP_GATEWAY_TOKEN` (`mcp::wiring`):
//!
//! | Name | Meaning |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | `NASIKO_STATE_URL` | Base URL of the agent state API (`{server}/api/agent-state`) |
//! | `NASIKO_AGENT_TOKEN` | The agent's state-scoped credential for that API |
//!
//! # State mode
//!
//! A deploy of a different image resets the agent's `state_mode` to `memory` (the new image may
//! not register a task store; one that does re-registers when it starts). A deploy of the same
//! image (restart, startup recovery) keeps it, so a durable agent is durable again as soon as it
//! is back. The caller says which it is with [`StateModeOnDeploy`].
//!
//! # Platform keys win
//!
//! The platform's keys are removed from the caller's env before anything is injected, so a user
//! secret or an uploaded `env` field of the same name cannot stand in for a credential - not even
//! when minting fails and the platform has nothing to put in its place.
//!
//! # Best-effort
//!
//! Like the wiring it composes, a failure here is logged and the deploy proceeds: an agent that
//! cannot reach the state API falls back to in-memory state, which is slower to recover but not
//! undeployable.
