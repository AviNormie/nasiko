//! Generic hook for enterprise-only supplemental context added to an agent's prompt, keyed by
//! agent id. Deliberately generic-named — no enterprise or memory-specific naming — matching the
//! `FinopsUserScope` precedent (`oss/server/src/observability/handler.rs`): OSS defines the
//! shape and ships a no-op default, EE composition roots override it, same as `routing_engine` /
//! `resource_stats` (see `AppState`'s own doc comments for those).
//!
//! Unlike `FinopsUserScope` (a per-request `Extension` populated by prior middleware), this is
//! an `AppState` field: the candidate-agent list this needs to react to (`orchestrator_stream`'s
//! agent selection) isn't known until partway through the handler, so there's no point before
//! the handler runs where per-request middleware could precompute anything — the handler calls
//! this service inline once it has that data, the same way it already calls `state.auth` inline.
