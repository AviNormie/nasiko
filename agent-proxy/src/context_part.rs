//! Appending admin-injected context (L1A knowledge and org policy/L0 today, at their independent
//! call sites — the edition's forwarding hop and `oss/server/src/router/a2a_dispatch.rs` /
//! `oss/server/src/agent_proxy.rs` respectively; a future L2 belief is the next caller) to an
//! outbound A2A message as its **own part**, rather than splicing it into the text part an agent
//! may parse for the platform's own history-glue marker.
//!
//! `session_history.rs`'s glue convention (`"{history}\n\nCurrent message: {query}"`) is a
//! documented, real pattern this codebase's own `oss/llm-router::latest_user_query` implements:
//! take only the text after `"\n\nCurrent message: "`, treat everything ahead of it as
//! already-handled history to discard. Any agent that follows that same documented convention —
//! which is exactly what it's published for — silently discards whatever text was prepended
//! ahead of that marker. Injected context (L1A facts, org policy, a future L2 belief) is not
//! history; it's meant to inform how the agent answers the *current* turn, every time. Splicing
//! it into the same field the marker convention discards is a category error, not a formatting
//! detail, and it isn't fixable by choosing a different position within that one field: whatever
//! goes ahead of the marker is lost, and whatever goes after it becomes part of what a
//! marker-aware agent treats as the user's literal instruction.
//!
//! The fix is to stop sharing the field. `parts` is already an array for exactly this reason —
//! this platform already sends multi-part messages on every call that carries a file attachment
//! (`file_parts`, threaded through `react-agent`'s `extra_parts`) — so appending a second part is
//! not a new capability, just a new use of one already proven in production. A marker-aware agent
//! still correctly extracts only the query from the one part that has the marker in it (arguably
//! *more* correctly than today, since that part no longer contains anything but the conversation);
//! it gets the injected context too only if it does what the A2A spec already expects of it —
//! consider every part of the message — which is a real protocol-level expectation, not an
//! internal convention specific to this platform.
//!
//! Appended, never inserted at the front: a caller that (incorrectly, but not unheard of for a
//! minimal SDK example) only reads `parts[0]` still gets the unmodified query in that position,
//! same as before this existed — worse for such a caller would be prepending and having it read
//! the injected block instead of the user's message.
